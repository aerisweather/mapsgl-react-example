# mapsgl-react-example

This project provides examples of how to work with our [MapsGL Javascript SDK](https://www.aerisweather.com/docs/mapsgl/) within a React application. We've included map-related components as part of these projects that you can use within your own applications as a starting point for integrating our mapping SDKs into your own React applications.

This project is set up to either use [Mapbox GL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) or [Maplibre GL](https://maplibre.org/projects/maplibre-gl-js/) mapping SDKs for the web.

## Getting Started

Follow the following steps before trying to run the project locally:

1. In the project directory, run `yarn install` to install all of the required dependencies.
2. Copy the `.env.tpl` file to `.env` and fill in your Mapbox token (if using Mapbox only) and your AerisWeather account's ID and secret keys.
3. From the root of the project directory, run `yarn start` to start up the local development server to launch the application.
